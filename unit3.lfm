      ''
      ' Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>'

      ' of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.'
      ''
      '                            Preamble'
      ''
      '  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for'
      'software and other kinds of works.'
      ''
      '  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed'
      'to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,'
      'the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to'
      'share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free'
      'software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the'
      'GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to'
      'any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to'
      'your programs, too.'
      ''
      '  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not'
      'price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you'
      'have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for'
      'them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you'
      'want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new'
      'free programs, and that you know you can do these things.'
      ''
      '  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you'
      'these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have'
      'certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if'
      'you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.'
      ''
      '  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether'
      'gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same'
      'freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive'
      'or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they'
      'know their rights.'
      ''
      '  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:'
      '(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License'
      'giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.'
      ''
      '  For the developers'' and authors'' protection, the GPL clearly explains'
      'that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users'' and'
      'authors'' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as'
      'changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to'
      'authors of previous versions.'
      ''
      '  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run'
      'modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer'
      'can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of'
      'protecting users'' freedom to change the software.  The systematic'
      'pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to'
      'use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we'
      'have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those'
      'products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we'
      'stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions'
      'of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.'
      ''
      '  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.'
      'States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of'
      'software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to'
      'avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could'
      'make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that'
      'patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.'
      ''
      '  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and'
      'modification follow.'
      ''
      '                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS'
      ''
      '  0. Definitions.'
      ''
      '  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.'
      ''

      'with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with'
      'the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do'
      'not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works'

      '    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified'
      '    it, and giving a relevant date.'

      '    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is'
      '    released under this License and any conditions added under section'
      '    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to'
      '    "keep intact all notices".'

      '    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not'
      '    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.'
      ''
      '    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display'
      '    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive'
      '    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your'
      '    work need not make them do so.'

      '    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as'
      '    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product'
      '    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a'
      '    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the'
      '    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical'
      '    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no'
      '    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this'
      '    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the'
      '    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.'
      ''
      '    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the'
      '    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This'
      '    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and'
      '    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord'
      '    with subsection 6b.'
      ''
      '    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated'
      '    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the'
      '    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no'
      '    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the'
      '    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to'
      '    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source'
      '    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)'
      '    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain'
      '    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the'
      '    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the'
      '    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is'
      '    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.'

      '    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided'
      '    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding'
      '    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no'
      '    charge under subsection 6d.'

      'into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,'
      'doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular'
      'product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a'
      'typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status'
      'of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user'
      'actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product'

      'fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the'
      'Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied'

      'the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a'
      'network may be denied when the modification itself materially and'
      'adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and'
      'protocols for communication across the network.'

      '    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some'
      '    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or'
      ''
      '    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that'
      '    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of'
      '    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for'
      '    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on'
